# Graph Analytics 

By: Brittney Benzio and Sabrina Collins

This tutorial will give an introduction into analyzing a graph using data from one of today’s most popular TV shows. Graph analytics is a powerful data analytics technique because it can reveal quick, meaningful insights on large amounts of relational data. 
Our goal is to teach the fundamentals of graph analytics in an easy-to-follow tutorial, and leave you with the knowledge to apply this technique to your own data problems. 

All of the content was built in Python 3.6.0, and if you do not currently have Python we suggest you download the Anaconda distribution of Python and/or use the `requirements.txt` file to load the environment we used to create the content.
